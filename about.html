                                <p><span class=" high">I</span>ndia is currently struggling with the growing issue of
                                    damaged roads and potholes, which has become a serious concern for public safety and
                                    urban mobility. The rapid urbanization and poor maintenance of infrastructure have
                                    contributed significantly to this problem. As cities grow and traffic increases, the
                                    lack of timely repairs and proper monitoring of roads leads to dangerous potholes
                                    that can cause accidents, vehicle damage, and traffic congestion. This issue is
                                    particularly severe during monsoon seasons, when waterlogging further weakens road
                                    surfaces.</p>
                                <p>To address this problem, a centralized complaint portal is essential, where citizens
                                    can easily report potholes and track the status of their complaints. Such platforms
                                    can help authorities respond faster, allocate resources efficiently, and ensure
                                    timely repair. Encouraging public participation and improving coordination between
                                    civic bodies and communities are crucial steps toward making our roads safer and
                                    more reliable.

                            <div>
                                <p>Across India, citizens face growing difficulties due to unaddressed civic issues such
                                    as pothole-ridden roads, water leakage, and garbage accumulation. These problems are
                                    often the result of rapid urban development without adequate planning. In many
                                    areas, roads remain damaged for months, causing frequent accidents and traffic jams.
                                    Residents often struggle to report these problems due to lack of clear channels or
                                    slow responses from local authorities.

                                    Water leakage in pipelines leads to both wastage and shortages, while unattended
                                    garbage piles become breeding grounds for diseases. In low-income and high-density
                                    areas, the impact is even more severe, with entire communities forced to live amidst
                                    filth and risk. Despite numerous complaints, bureaucratic delays and
                                    inter-departmental confusion stall timely action.

                                </p>

                                <p> These issues impact everyday
                                    life, from students being late to school due to poor roads, to families dealing with
                                    unsanitary conditions. Often, these problems continue because of limited awareness,
                                    insufficient manpower, and lack of accountability.

                                    To solve this, there’s a need for a reliable complaint portal that allows the public
                                    to raise issues quickly and track resolutions. A system that connects people
                                    directly with the authorities can bring transparency, speed up repairs, and improve

                                <p>Kanpur, July 29 – In the heart of the bustling city, a silent danger lurks beneath
                                    the wheels of commuters – potholes. What may seem like harmless patches of uneven
                                    road have now turned into death traps, injuring dozens and claiming lives across the
                                    city's major intersections and inner lanes. <br>

                                    What’s worse is the endless blame game between departments," says Manisha Saini, a
                                    local RWA member from Barra-8, visibly frustrated. "Whenever we try to raise a
                                    complaint about something as basic as a pothole or garbage collection, Nagar Nigam
                                    tells us it's not under their control and forwards us to the PWD. Then, PWD
                                    officials casually tell us that the stretch comes under the Smart City plan and that
                                    their hands are tied. Sometimes, they even say it's the contractor’s fault and not
                                    their department’s. No one takes responsibility. No one follows up. We go from one
                                    office to another, file complaints that disappear into files, and make calls that
                                    are never returned. And while departments keep passing the buck.

                                accident last week while riding on GT Road. “It had rained heavily the night before. A
                                large pothole was hidden under stagnant water. My bike skidded, and I fell head-first. I
                                was unconscious for several minutes before someone helped me,” recalls Ramesh, now
                                recovering with a fractured wrist and deep bruises.

                            <div class=" flex flex-col gap-0.5">
                                <p>New Delhi, July 30 – In the national capital of India, known for its heritage, power
                                    corridors, and global attention, a silent and stinking problem continues to fester
                                    at every street corner – uncollected garbage and waste mismanagement.

                                    Across localities from Kalkaji to Seelampur, Narela to Sangam Vihar, the issue isn’t
                                    just about overflowing bins anymore. It’s about daily life choking under piles of
                                    rotting waste, breeding grounds for disease, and the unbearable stench that has now
                                    become part of people's morning routine.

                                    In Bhajanpura, 11-year-old Anaya coughs constantly due to the garbage heap right
                                    outside her home. “It smells all day. Flies come into our house. My daughter has
                                    asthma, and the doctor says it’s getting worse,” says her mother, Pooja Devi,
                                    pointing to the black sludge seeping into the street from the nearby overflowing
                                    dumpster..</p>
                                <p>This is not an isolated story.

                                    A recent survey by a Delhi-based civic monitoring group found that nearly 68% of
                                    residential colonies report irregular or non-existent garbage collection. Even where
                                    collection happens, waste segregation is almost zero, and bins remain open—exposed
                                    to animals, rain, and scavengers.

                                    In Chandni Chowk, despite being a commercial hub and a major tourist zone, the back
                                    alleys remain filled with plastic, food waste, and broken goods. “We clean the
                                    shopfronts daily, but the municipality skips alternate days. The garbage returns
                                    faster than customers,” says Rajesh Mehra, a cloth shop owner.

                                <p>In every city, civic issues like potholes, overflowing garbage, broken streetlights,
                                    or open drains are not just infrastructure failures — they’re failures of
                                    communication. Often, residents don’t know where to complain or whom to approach.
                                    Even when they do, complaints are lost between departments or ignored completely.
                                    This gap between the public and the authorities is what JanSetu aims to eliminate.
                                </p>
                                <p>JanSetu is not just another complaint app — it is a centralized civic grievance
                                    portal that connects citizens directly with the right department. Whether it's the
                                    municipal corporation, public works department, or the drainage board, JanSetu knows
                                    where your complaint should go. The system is designed to auto-route every issue,
                                    ensuring no complaint is left hanging in confusion or bureaucracy.
                                    Through this digital bridge, citizens can now register issues related to roads,
                                    garbage,
                                    lights, drainage, and more — all in one place. They can upload photos, tag their
                                    location, track the status in real-time, and even escalate if the issue isn't
                                    resolved
                                    in time. This ensures transparency, accountability, and faster response, something
                                    that
                                    has long been missing from traditional civic systems.
                                    Most importantly, JanSetu redefines public participation. It makes every citizen a
                                    stakeholder in the city’s well-being. By acting as a two-way communication channel

                                the city truly improve.
                                JanSetu doesn't just record complaints — it records trust. When citizens see their
                                concerns being acknowledged and resolved without the need to chase officials, it builds
                                a renewed sense of faith in the system. For too long, people have been silent sufferers,
                                believing that raising a complaint is a waste of time. JanSetu is here to change that
                                mindset, by showing that action can, and will, follow every voice raised.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Already, in the initial phase of testing, JanSetu has resolved over 80% of registered
                                issues within the first 7 days, ranging from clearing garbage piles to fixing broken
                                streetlights. These aren't just numbers — these are cleaner neighborhoods, safer roads,
                                and hopeful citizens. With time, scale, and public support, JanSetu aspires to become
                                not just a civic tool, but a symbol of a new India — where every problem is visible,
                                every department is reachable, and every citizen is heard. <br>

                                Because in a city where problems are visible on every street corner, what we truly need
                                is not silence, but a system that listens, responds, and takes action. For years, people
                                have raised their voices, filed complaints, and waited—often in vain. JanSetu changes
                                that reality. It transforms helplessness into empowerment, and complaints into change.

                                shifted between departments, and public grievances are left unresolved. In the absence
                                of quick action, trust erodes. Citizens need more than promises—they need a system that

                                        responsibility. It encourages every citizen to play an active role in shaping
                                        cleaner, safer, and better-managed neighborhoods. When people and departments
                                        work together through a shared channel, real change becomes not only possible,
                                        but visible.</p>

                                    <p>Many citizens feel helpless when civic issues like broken roads, water leaks, or
                                        garbage piles go unresolved for weeks. Instead of clear communication and fast
                                        response, complaints often get lost between departments. This delay causes
                                        frustration and loss of trust. JanSetu solves this problem by creating a
                                        transparent and efficient bridge between people and authorities. With one
                                        platform handling all issues, each complaint reaches the correct department
                                        directly. No more confusion, no more helplessness—just fast, trackable civic
                                        action that empowers the public and strengthens trust.</p>

                                    <p>JanSetu listens to the people and responds with action. Citizens can now report
                                        problems anytime and track their status without visiting government offices. The
                                        portal also promotes civic education by helping people understand how local
                                        systems work. When departments respond quickly through JanSetu, it builds a
                                        stronger sense of community. Schools, RWAs, and local clubs can also spread
                                        awareness about using the platform. When citizens and officials work together
                                        using a common tool like JanSetu, real improvement becomes not just a hope—but a
                                        habit.
                                        The real-time updates and transparent complaint system create accountability
                                        among departments. People no longer feel ignored—they feel seen, heard, and
                                        valued. JanSetu turns frustration into participation by giving everyone a voice.
                                        This digital bridge is more than a service—it's a shared responsibility.</p>

                                        People across cities and towns face problems like broken roads, water leakage,
                                        garbage piles, and poor lighting. Earlier, these issues remained unresolved for
                                        weeks or even months due to confusion about which department to approach. Now,
                                        with JanSetu, complaints are easily registered and directed to the correct
                                        department without delay. This platform empowers citizens to speak up and get
                                        the support they deserve without needing to visit offices physically.</p>

                                    <p>Awareness is key, and JanSetu also promotes civic education in communities. By
                                        using this platform, people learn how departments work, what their roles are,
                                        and how to hold them accountable. RWAs, schools, and local clubs can organize
                                        workshops and campaigns to teach citizens how to use JanSetu. When people know
                                        their rights and tools, they feel more confident in taking part in local
                                        governance. This leads to faster resolutions and a more connected and informed
                                        community.</p>

                                    <p>JanSetu builds a powerful partnership between the community and administration.
                                        It focuses not just on solving problems but on improving the system through
                                        collaboration. A unified approach where all departments respond on a single
                                        platform creates better coordination and transparency. As more people use
                                        JanSetu, the system learns, adapts, and becomes more efficient. When technology,
                                        people, and governance come together with a shared mission, real change is
                                        possible. Together, JanSetu is turning civic action into a daily habit, shaping
                                        smarter cities and more responsive governance.</p>

                                <p>For years, citizens across India have faced daily challenges like damaged roads,
                                    broken streetlights, open drains, and unattended garbage—often without knowing whom
                                    to contact or how to get help. These civic issues affect safety, health, and overall
                                    quality of life, yet many go unreported due to complicated procedures and poor
                                    coordination between departments. People often feel frustrated when their complaints
                                    are ignored or passed between agencies without resolution. In such a situation, a
                                    system like <strong>JanSetu</strong> brings hope and clarity.</p>

                                <p>JanSetu acts as a digital bridge between citizens and authorities by offering a
                                    simple, accessible way to report civic issues. Once submitted, complaints are
                                    automatically directed to the correct department, reducing delays and confusion.
                                    Citizens also receive updates on the status of their reports, helping them feel
                                    heard and involved. This builds trust in governance and gives residents a voice in
                                    their local development. JanSetu is not just a complaint tool—it’s a step toward
                                    smarter, more responsive urban management.</p>

                                <p>When people are empowered to raise their concerns and see results, their connection
                                    with the community and local governance grows stronger. RWAs, schools, and citizen
                                    volunteers can further encourage adoption by promoting awareness about the platform.
                                    In this way, JanSetu is not just solving problems—it’s building a culture of active
                                    citizenship and shared responsibility. With better coordination and citizen
                                    involvement, cities can become safer, cleaner, and more livable for everyone. The
                                    solution begins with a click, but the impact reaches every street and neighborhood.

                                progress comes when local voices and national vision go hand in hand. While it’s natural
                                for people to support leaders who promise better roads, jobs, or services in their area,
                                it’s equally important to think about issues that affect the whole country—like safety,
                                education, and development.</p>

                            <p>Instead of choosing between regional and national priorities, we need a mindset that
                                connects both. Platforms like JanSetu can help bridge this gap by making sure local
                                complaints are heard while contributing to broader progress. When local solutions are
                                part of a national plan, every citizen benefits more equally.</p>

                            <p>Media, institutions, and communities can play a key role by encouraging informed

                                ‘what’s in it for my area’ to ‘what’s better for all of us.’ A united approach makes

                            <p>In India, citizen engagement is often driven by local concerns, which can overshadow
                                broader governance goals. With JanSetu, we aim to bridge this gap by offering a platform
                                where both regional issues and national responsibilities are addressed together. Instead
                                of waiting for leaders to fulfill selective promises, citizens can directly report
                                problems—from potholes to safety issues—and track their resolution, regardless of
                                location. This shifts the focus from individual gain to collective progress.</p>

                            <p>JanSetu reduces the fragmentation caused by region-based politics by giving every citizen
                                equal access to redressal mechanisms. Leaders and departments can no longer prioritize
                                only vote-bank regions; every complaint, no matter where it comes from, enters a common
                                system. This strengthens transparency and holds officials accountable across the board.
                                Through features like status tracking, department coordination, and civic education
                                tools, JanSetu empowers people to think beyond local boundaries and engage in meaningful

                                people begin to trust the system again. This reduces frustration, builds transparency,
                                and encourages a sense of shared responsibility. Communities become better informed and
                                more willing to collaborate with authorities, leading to smarter, faster solutions.</p>

                                and uncollected garbage often go unnoticed due to lack of proper reporting channels.
                                JanSetu empowers citizens to report these issues directly from their phones or
                                computers, ensuring faster action and better accountability from municipal bodies.</p>

                            <p>Instead of waiting endlessly or depending on political outreach, users can simply upload

                                not only saves time but also builds trust between the public and local administration.
                                By removing bureaucratic hurdles, JanSetu promotes inclusive development, where every
                                voice is heard and every issue is treated with urgency—regardless of region or status.

                                by citizens. This results in the neglect of critical civic issues such as broken roads,

                                issues, while not always seen as urgent by authorities, greatly impact the quality of
                                life for common people.</p>

                            <p>Due to this neglect, municipal services become inefficient and residents are left with no
                                proper channel to raise their concerns. Public grievances often go unheard, and the lack
                                of a transparent system leaves people frustrated. In such situations, citizens may be
                                forced to rely on political influence or personal connections just to get basic civic
                                problems resolved.</p>

                            <p>JanSetu addresses this gap by giving people a direct, transparent, and reliable way to

                            <p>This focus on regional issues can create gaps in crime prevention and law enforcement.
                                Many local leaders, driven by the need to secure votes, fail to address rising crime
                                rates in their areas. Instead of focusing on long-term solutions to tackle violence,
                                theft, or drug-related crimes, they concentrate on winning the next election by
                                promising short-term benefits to their region. This lack of focus on crime leads to weak
                                law enforcement, poorly trained police, and an overall lack of resources to deal with
                                rising criminal activities. voters need to shift their focus from regional interests to
                                national well-being. Leaders who prioritize public safety, crime prevention.</p>

                            <p>As a result, criminals feel emboldened, knowing that the attention of the government is
                                elsewhere. Regions that are neglected by political leaders may become breeding grounds
                                for gang violence, drug trafficking, and organized crime. Without a unified national
                                strategy to combat these issues, crime spreads unchecked. Local leaders may even turn a
                                blind eye to criminal activities if they believe it will secure more votes or political
                                support in their region.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the regional approach to voting weakens national efforts to address crime. When
                                voters elect leaders who only focus on their region’s problems, it fractures the
                                country’s ability to come together and tackle large-scale issues. National programs to
                                strengthen police forces, improve the justice system, or implement crime prevention
                                strategies become difficult to implement because the focus is on local politics rather
                                than the overall safety of the country. National programs to strengthen police forces,

                                then can the country work toward lasting solutions to crime and violence.</p>
